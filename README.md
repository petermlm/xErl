A compiler from a simple language to x86 in Erlang. The language is just a simple integer calculator with variables and functions.

This is just a personal project of mine and I did it to learn Erlang and x86.

Program:

    10+12*2
    x = 50
    x * 2
    def f(a): a*x + 10
    f(10)

Output:

    34
    100
    110
